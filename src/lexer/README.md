Instructions on using the Lexical Analyzer:
Using this tool is simple

1. Have your rat24s source code in the folder or move the script into the folder with your file.
2. Run the following code
```
python3 ratlexer.py filename
```

Note: filenames must end with the rat24s extension or the file will not be accepted

3. The script will read the source code and generate a token sheet!

Update v1.0: The ratlexer will also output the file to a .txt file as well as print out the output in the terminal

Note: There is a test file that you can run to test the script
